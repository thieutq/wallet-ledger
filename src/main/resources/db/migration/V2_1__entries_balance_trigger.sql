-- Database-level backstop for the double-entry invariant: the entries of a
-- transfer must sum to zero. The application already refuses unbalanced
-- writes (LedgerService only ever writes exactly 2 balanced entries per
-- transfer), but a check the database enforces holds even against a future
-- application bug: the database will not let the books go out of balance.
--
-- The trigger is DEFERRED to commit time because a transfer's entries are
-- inserted as separate rows within one transaction; mid-transaction the sum
-- is legitimately non-zero, so only the state at COMMIT is meaningful.
--
-- Scope: this enforces balance, not row immutability — deleting BOTH entries
-- of a transfer sums to zero and passes. Immutability is an application rule
-- (nothing ever deletes ledger rows); the backstop guarantees that whatever
-- rows exist always net to zero per transfer.

-- Refuse to install the backstop over already-corrupt data: if any existing
-- transfer is unbalanced, fail the migration loudly instead of hiding it.
